# PyBer Challenge

## Overview
This analysis was completed for a ficticious ride share company Pyber to analyse differences in ride-share habits by 3 city types: Urban, Suburban, Rural

## Results

There is a noticable difference between the amount of drivers and rides given between the 3 city types. In both rural and suburban areas the drivers all average more than one ride given. However, in urban cities there are more drivers and the total rides are less than one ride per driver. The urban markets are saturated with many drivers so fares are cheaper and the average fare per driver is much lower than rural/suburan areas. Urban areas are the most profitable for PyBer, with total fares for urban areas being greater than rural and suburban combined.

## Summary 
With the number of drivers in the urban area it appears that this would be the city type for potential profit gains without adding more drivers. If PyBer can come up with an incentive program for these urban drivers this would be the greatest opportunity for profit gains without investment in new drivers.

End of February or early March would be the best time for ad campaigns in all city types. There is a peak in fares at this time in all city types, this could be a good time for a "ride now" type discount.

Rural and Suburban cities have higher average fares per ride and per driver. Be wary of ad campaigns in these areas thinking it will increase profits. There could be opportunity for profit gains in these cities, however with the total number of drivers being lower than rides given it could mean that these markets are already saturated and the drivers that are there currently are already competing for the fares.
